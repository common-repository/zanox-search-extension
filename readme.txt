This plugin extends the default wordpress search by integrating zanox
advertiser product data into the frontend search result list of your blog.



== Description ==

The plugin queries the zanox web service API for suitable advertising programs
and products based on the search query and displayes appropriate products
within the search result page.

The plugin allows the configuration of the sales region as well as a minimum
and maximum price for products. You can even select specific advertisers and
product categories for an optimal selection of products that will be displayed
within the search result list.

Additional it is possible to configure how many products should be displayed
and if they should be displayed above or underneath the search results on
your blog.

You need a Zanox Web Services ConnectId to use the plugin.
